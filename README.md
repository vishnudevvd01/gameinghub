# [GAMMING HUB] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: [ Zoom boys ]


### Team Members
- Team Lead: A R Gautham - College of engineering and management punnapra

### Project Description
A Game Hub web application that contains multiple fun mini-games, all accessible from a single interface. Players can choose any game and start playing instantly without downloading anything.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Gamers often get tired of opening multiple tabs or searching for different games separately. Obviously, having all games in one place is absolutely essential for survival‚Ä¶ or maybe not.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We created a one-stop Game Hub where you can switch between different games instantly. It saves you the exhausting 3 seconds it would take to type ‚ÄúTic Tac Toe‚Äù into Google.
